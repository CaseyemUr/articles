<br>CLICK  icon ABOVE! - You can now get the Fortnite Minty Pickaxe by following the process of generating an unused Minty Pickaxe, and that way you can redeem it in your Epic account.  After that, you can redeem that code in your Epic Store account with a copy-paste method! So, wait no more and grab free minty pickaxe codes! The first release of Merry Mint Pickaxe codes was in October 2025.  Without much info, Epic games just release a post that tells us these cards will be available to get with purchases in physical stores.  This tutorial shows you the way to get it worldwide without stepping into a store.  If we're going to be technical about it, then the Axe of Champions from the FNCS is without a doubt the rarest Pickaxe in the game.  Only one player can own it at a time, and you'll have to be the current Fortnite Championship Series champion to own it.  Once the player who owns it loses their spot at the top, it will move on to the next champion.
